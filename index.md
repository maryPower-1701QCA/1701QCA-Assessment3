*This project is a lucky wheel that is designed for selecting an option from various ingredients. When you press the button on the microbit, it will spin for a random period of time between 1 - 2.5 seconds and then the arrow lands on a random ingredient. This project is designed for anybody, as it could be used as a fun game or challenge during quarantine.*
